* Copy `.env.dist` to `.env`, and modify to taste
* Run `bin/www`

## Configuration

The easiest way to get started is to copy `.env.dist` to `.env` and modify it. Particularly make sure you replace the
example secrets with your own. The `.env` file is loaded by the server at start-up, and merged into the environment.

The `.env.dist` file has a list of options you can configure. You could also set the options via environment variables.
